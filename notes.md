## AWS Notes

behold! A modification!

Server address: 18.232.252.246

.pem is the key/value filetype we used

From the `cs4` folder (I guess we're never filling in the full class number now) (and I just realized that's actually the folder for the other cs class. welp) in git bash: `ssh -i 260totoro.pem ubuntu@18.232.252.246`

from the cs260 folder, it's `ssh -i ../cs4/260totoro.pem ubuntu@18.232.252.246`

in console, use `exit` to exit the ssh (this won't stop or terminate the server don't worry)

## HTML Notes
the  `a` in  `a href` stands for anchor, interesting!

besides `src`, `img` has other attributes including `width` and `alt` which sets the alt text. you can just put them all in the same tag.

Apparently there's a type of section in main called `<aside>` which I'm still not sure I completely understand, apparently it's for stuff that doesn't fit the main page's content? I'm not sure how it actually gets implemented differently but we'll probably find out soon.

`div` is a block, `span` is inline

## CSS Notes

I'm never quite sure what to put in these things

in flex displays, `justify-content` aligns items on the main axis and `align-items` aligns them on the other axis. `justify-content` options: `flex-start` for beginning, `flex-end` for right side/bottom/end, `center` for center. aso other options but those are the main three i think i particularly want to remember.
