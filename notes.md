## AWS Notes

behold! A modification!

Server address: 18.232.252.246

.pem is the key/value filetype we used

From the `cs4` folder (I guess we're never filling in the full class number now) (and I just realized that's actually the folder for the other cs class. welp) in git bash: `ssh -i 260totoro.pem ubuntu@18.232.252.246`

from the cs260 folder, it's `ssh -i ../cs4/260totoro.pem ubuntu@18.232.252.246`

in console, use `exit` to exit the ssh (this won't stop or terminate the server don't worry)

## HTML Notes
the  `a` in  `a href` stands for anchor, interesting!
