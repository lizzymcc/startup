## AWS Notes

behold! A modification!

Server address: 18.232.252.246

.pem is the key/value filetype we used

From the `cs4` folder (I guess we're never filling in the full class number now) (and I just realized that's actually the folder for the other cs class. welp) in git bash: `ssh -i 260totoro.pem ubuntu@18.232.252.246`

from the cs260 folder, it's `ssh -i ../cs4/260totoro.pem ubuntu@18.232.252.246`

in console, use `exit` to exit the ssh (this won't stop or terminate the server don't worry)

domain name: oldquizletlearn260.click




## HTML Notes
the  `a` in  `a href` stands for anchor, interesting!

besides `src`, `img` has other attributes including `width` and `alt` which sets the alt text. you can just put them all in the same tag.

Apparently there's a type of section in main called `<aside>` which I'm still not sure I completely understand, apparently it's for stuff that doesn't fit the main page's content? I'm not sure how it actually gets implemented differently but we'll probably find out soon.

`div` is a block, `span` is inline

## CSS Notes

I'm never quite sure what to put in these things

in flex displays, `justify-content` aligns items on the main axis and `align-items` aligns them on the other axis. `justify-content` options: `flex-start` for beginning, `flex-end` for right side/bottom/end, `center` for center. aso other options but those are the main three i think i particularly want to remember.

## React notes

I keep learning cool things but I'm never sure what to write in here about them. idk. react seems cool. I get the feeling that this stage of the project might be better suited for One Navbar On All Pages than what I'm doing, but let's try this!

alright, I got it basically working. I'm getting the vibe that I"ll be doing a lot of stuff with parameters in the next project, but I was probably going to regardless. also not sure when we'll be adding and using databases but that'll probably be a big part of it as well.

## react part 2 notes

Javascript destructuring -- 
if t is an array, then 
`const [b,c,d] = t` will set b to t[0], c to t[1], d to t[2], etc.
If t isn't long enough, the overflowing variable(s) becomes undefined.

`const [a, b, ...c] = t` will set a and b to t[0] and t[1], and then all the rest of t is stored in c as an array, like c becomes (python) t[2:-1] (does that notation in javascript? or just python?)

you can also set a default value for the variables in the start that they'll use if the list isn't long enough to include them.

### `react.useState` uses destructuring!

<small> also you can put `code blocks` inside headers in markdown!</small>

it returns... the inital value (that it had as a parameter) and a function that updates the variable/state to whatever is input... ok, i think i understand this, some of the stuff behind the scenes is still confusing but now I get why setColor or whatever function it is never needs to be defined elsewhere in the code. 

ok so what is an effect hook...
useState is a hook, and useEffect is a hook... I feel like I'm missing some information. Like what the difference is between a state & effect, and how you would access them outside of hooks. and how they relate to needing an object or class or something.

----
use `npm install` from the root directory to turn the packages.json etc into node_modules! *Once those are in* you can run `npm run dev` with vite. if that's in the packages/node modules ofc.

---
hm. I've been installing npm things in the service folder but it's not creating new package.json files, it's adding to the ones in the surrounding folder. that's... probably okay? NOPE IT'S NOT

We need to use `npm init -y` to set up the packages to start

13 mar 2025 -- ngl i am so lost right now. Something isn't working with the server and the front end connecting and I'm not sure where the problem is bc it could be any number of things bc I'm not really sure how it's supposed to work? I'm trying to base it off of simon but there's things like. like the vite.config file which I'm not sure if we're supposed to just *make* or if there's some npm thing we should call? aaaaagh
update: figured it out. kinda. it's working now and I think I mostly understand why

ARGHH


## websocket notes
8 apr 2025 -- I am so lost. I got an extension until thursday on this deliverable which is great because I still haven't properly started ahd I'm not even sure how to implement it. There's not a lot of user-to-user notification applicability. If it doesn't need to be across multiple clients I could probalby do something with the sunset notifier but I'm not sure if that meets the requirements if we're supposed to be able to test it with multiple browsers.

Also I forgot to push my readme commit to github before I turned in the DB deliverable so currently I have a 0 on that and need to contact a TA and stuff

also also the requirements for this one say we need at least 10 git commits *spread across the assignment time* and. I haven't started yet. And I'm always forgetting to do git commits partway through my work. Might do a commit just with this and the other stuff I've messed with since last commit (Mostly irrelevant to functionality unelss I wind up implementing set editing). Not sure if that counts though lol.

OK so for websocket... what could I do that notifies players things from another player?

- again, easiest option is if we use this to get the sunset notifier working properly, though idk if that would mess with the API application part.

- notify when there's a new high score? Maybe, but which screen(s) would that notify on? All of them? In the sidebar?
Maybe if the user has a score and someone beats it on the same set?
- maybe a concurrent users thing?
- IDK MOST OF THIS STUFF IS HANDLED IN THE DATABASE RIGHT NOW

- maybe we can do some sort of placeholder ping thing just to test if the websocket is working with multiple clients and then use it for a one client thing?

I should look at the project requirements again i think

ok so the first specification says it *can* be "realtime data that your service is generatiing" so I can probably do soemthing with the sunset api. thank heavens.


Also if I have time I should really try and mkae the database endpoints more secure bc they're kinda. Not. right now. but websocket stuff first.


---
alright, I think I'm starting to get somewhere, but fun fact: the debugging method taught in the schedule doesn't work on firefox, only chromium(?) browsers. so now I have to dig out microsoft edge lol. hopefully that won't be a problem in the actual implementation. the simon websocket thing works fine in firefox.
WAIT possibly nvm i needed to reconfigure vite. ...actually no that wouldn't affect the debugging we were doing would it. drat.


ok so looking at the simon thing... it has these add- and remove-handler functions, but I thiiink it only needs those because the scores thing needs to be able to show a flexible number of results?
wait, no, I think they got that with the list of events and the handlers is maybe something different?
Ok I'm debugging the websocket one and the handlers stuff is really confusing, like I think removehandler isn't actually removing any handlers, and it's a list but they're all the same thing? Idk. Let's just deal with the other stuff first.

------
OK SO we need to figure out what data exactly we're sending to and from the socket thing, and the pipeline

ok so the play game, before sending, will get the sunrise/set api info for the location, figure out which is next after the current time (I think sometimes the API only gives you the ones for the calendar day even if both events have passed) and, *if location (and sunrise/set notifications) are enabled* send the request to the socket
so 
TO:
	- a datetime (perhaps a span of datetimes?)
	- whether the notification is about a sunrise or a sunset
	- whatever information the websocket needs to know which socket to send it to

Then the websocket end will figure out the time and notify back when it is time, or within a certain range of the time, we'll decide it on that end.
FROM:
	- The time of the sunrise/set
	- which it is
and then the frontend will parse the times in the timezone, and make the response text. and eventually hide it.
AND once it gets the notification maybe it recalculates the next time and sends that over?
ok that works...

Ok we've got the frontend sending stuff to the websocket working! And possibly we've got it handling the response right, idk, the backend isn't sending responses yet.
I've realized that this is gonna be a tricky one to test since its intended use is something that only happens, well, at sunrise and sunset. So we're probably gonna have to figure out other ways to do that? Is there a way I can trick my browser int o thinking it's a different time?  
---
OK so we figured out the different time thing -- in edge or other chromium browsers in the debug panel there should be a tab (you might have to use the plus to find it) called "Sensors" where you can emulate different locations!

Also it turns out you ccan store custom variables on sockets in a websocketserver so that makes my job way easier.
